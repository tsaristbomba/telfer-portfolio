              when my parents, both high school teachers, needed a computer to
              work. They bought a white IBM Windows 98 PC, which I played games
              and learned a lot from, enjoyed every second of it. Knowing that I
              would end up working in tech wasn't a stretch{" "}

              As time passes I started to study Computer Engineering to after
              find out that coding itself is what suits me more, so I made the
              change to Computer Science. In the meantime I was learning Web
              Development and started making games and websites for fun, to
              later decide to do this professionally, and here I am{" "}

              My other big passions are Music, Crypto and Games. As described
              before, I started coding building games as well as websites, and
              to this day gaming is a big passion of mine. While doing anything
              I like to listen to a lot of music, and this are some of my
